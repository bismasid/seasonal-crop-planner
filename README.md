# Seasonal Crop Planner 🌱

Created by: Bisma Siddiqui

## Overview
The Seasonal Crop Planner is a Python program that helps users decide what crops to plant based on the season and whether they want fruits or vegetables.

The program:
- Asks the user for the current season
- Asks whether they want to plant fruits or vegetables
- Displays suitable crops for that season
- Shows estimated average yields in **pounds**
- Generates a bar chart of expected yield production

This project was created as a final project for CIS 173 and as an extension of a previous HTML/CSS website project.
